# Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Data
In this project, we worked with a data set that was collected to help doctors diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). Each row in the data set represents a single patient who was treated in the past and whose diagnosis is known. For each patient, we have a bunch of measurements from a blood test. We’d like to find which measurements are most useful for diagnosing CKD, and develop a way to classify future patients as “has CKD” or “doesn’t have CKD” based on their blood test results.
